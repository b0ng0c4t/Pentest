It's a open source program for reading, modifying, and manipulating images, videos, audios and PDF metadata.
Metadata are the additional data added to multimedia files. For example, the metadata of photographs are the
additional data like the name of the device, the resolution of the image, the location the image was taken at, 
the date of capture and modification and more.

exiftool FILE     -> list all metadata
exiftool -h FILE > FILE.html      -> export metadata to html file


#--- FIND
find / -type [d/f] [-name, =perm] FILE 2>/dev/null

#--- CREATING PATTERNS FOR BUFFER OVERFLOWS
msf-pattern_create -l NUMBER
once we get the EIP HEX crash, copy/remember the numbers
msf-pattern_offset -l NUMBER -q EIP_HEX_CRASH
this will get us in which char number app crashes
