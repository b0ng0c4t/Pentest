It's a open source program for reading, modifying, and manipulating images, videos, audios and PDF metadata.
Metadata are the additional data added to multimedia files. For example, the metadata of photographs are the
additional data like the name of the device, the resolution of the image, the location the image was taken at, 
the date of capture and modification and more.

exiftool FILE     -> list all metadata
exiftool -h FILE > FILE.html      -> export metadata to html file
