#--- PAM (PLUGGABLE AUTHENTICATION MODULES)
https://www.linux.com/news/understanding-pam/
 PAM is a collection of modules that essentially form a barrier between a
service on your system, and the user of the service. The modules can have
widely varying purposes, from disallowing a login to users from a particular
UNIX group (or netgroup, or subnet…), to implementing resource limits so
that your ‘research’ group can’t hog system resources.
PAM is used by major commercial UNIX flavors such as AIX, HP-UX and Solaris,
as well as the major free versions of UNIX, like FreeBSD. Almost all
distributions of Linux also implement PAM, though I believe Slackware is
still the one notable holdout in this area.
